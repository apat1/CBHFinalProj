# CBHFinalProj
This project is Capstone Project sponsored by Crescent Bay Holdings. 
This is the 5th iteration of the project after making various changes to the project scope and requirements.
The goal was to have a site that can pull real estate economic data to display and store. 
The FRED API was used to retrieve data from the FRED website. 
Also requested was the functionality to store Belfiore data downloaded as Excel files. 
An account management feature has been added for the future so users can pull data that was stored.
